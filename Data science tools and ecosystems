7. arithmetic expression examples:
arithmatic operators <br>
* multiplication 3*4  <br>
/ division 4/2  <br>
- subtraction 2-1  <br>
+ addition 1+2  <br>
% modulus (remainder) 3%4  <be>


Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers.
print("mulltiply numbers 3 & 7")
print(3*7)

print("add nubmers 3 & 7")
print(3+7)
mulltiply numbers 3 & 7
21
add nubmers 3 & 7
10
9.Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours
minutes = 125
print("converting ", minutes, " minutes to hours")
hours = minutes/60
print(minutes, " minutes are", hours, " hours")
converting  125  minutes to hours
125  minutes are 2.0833333333333335  hours
